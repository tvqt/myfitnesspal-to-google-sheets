You need to [authorise pygsheets](https://pygsheets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/authorization.html) and [authenticate python-myfitnesspal](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/python-myfitnesspal#authentication).
The script expects a spreadsheet called "Fitness data" in the root folder of your Google Drive, containing a worksheet called "MFP", with the first column called "Date" containing dates.

* Kilojoules (or Intake)
* Exercise
* Goal
* Protein
* Carbohydrates (or Carbs)
